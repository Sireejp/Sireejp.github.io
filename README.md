2. This is my first GitHub account and excited to learn new skills and ideas.

3. Made my first repository as an assignment and getting into the process of learn the tools.

4. I downloaded the GitHub desktop application and installed on my local computer. Then open the app and was automatically promted with syncing the application with the GitHub account that I had. Once synced I was able to see the repository that I created and had a clone tab available to clone it to my local machine.
